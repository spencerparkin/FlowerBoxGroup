Just compile and statically link with wxWidgets-3.x.x and off you go.  Patch the solution file for whatever version you're running.

I wrote this program as fast as I could, so the code isn't very clean.  It served its purpose and now I'm done with it.  It's actually not a terrible simulator of the puzzle (Lan-Lan Rex Cube) if that's all for which you use it.
